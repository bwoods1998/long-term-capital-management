# Changelog

One entry per deploy, newest first, from the options overhaul of Sept 26, 2026 on. Earlier history is
in [archive/](archive/README.md).

Each entry: the UTC time; what was deployed (House release id and main commit, gateway version, or
site version); the pull requests it carries; the money digest and when the grant was ratified, if
it moved; what was verified on the box, and how; and the rollback floor when it changes. A merged
pull request is not an entry until it is deployed.

## Rollback floor

No House release on the new state root yet. The first one sets the floor: never roll back past it,
because the release before it (Deploy G, `20260926T032739Z-aaf5ac74637c`) would run the old Kalshi
and Jev code on the new root.

## 2026-09-26: the options overhaul, before the first House release

**Merged, not yet deployed to the House**

- 06:39:40Z #356, the plan (`docs/goals/LTCM_OPTIONS_SWARM.md`); main `46ec3433`.
- 07:21:04Z #357, the publisher's schema 2 for the options site; main `d1855afc`.
- 07:49:22Z #359, the House options-only (Wave 2a): `auto_update` false and a missing key means off;
  `floor_box.py` and `gateway_admin.py` off the legacy package; the grant `options-swarm-20260928`
  in `league/live_trading.py` with every real-money call site asking it; no Kalshi, Jev, lab,
  foundry, semantic lab, feed, campaign or pacer piece in the service or the tick; the config's dead
  keys removed; CI runs the Gym's dependencies; Merton never auto-merges. `real_money` false. Main
  `6c715d83`.
- Open: #358, the Gym (`league/gym/`), under review.

**07:21Z, the site** (`~/Work/personal-site` PR #9, schema 2; Worker version `650a8ac1`)

- Deployed, then reset with `/api/capital/reset?confirm=erase-everything` on the real record and the
  `test` and `canary` tapes. The real record's 20,000 events, 1,604 history points, 1 checkpoint and
  136 desks were cleared.
- The reset pair: `PERFORMANCE_START_AT` 2026-09-26T06:25:30.000Z, start equity $481.65, the same as
  `performance` in `league/config.json`.
- Verified: all three checkpoint routes answer 404 until the new House publishes; the page reads "AI
  agents trading options." and its HTML names no venue (re-checked read-only at 07:54Z).

**06:24-06:58Z, the old House stopped and archived** (Wave 0; no deploy)

- 06:24:56Z the old House stopped (`floor_box.py stop --reason "options overhaul"`) on release
  `20260926T032739Z-aaf5ac74637c` (Deploy G, main `a1f9a8e7`), paused for maintenance since
  03:55:56Z: 128 agents alive in 121 families, 627 dead.
- 06:25:00Z the old grant `earned-live-20260921` disabled.
- 06:25:30Z the Brokerage Account's leftovers closed: two resting crypto sells cancelled, SOL and XRP
  sold; equity $481.65, with $0.03 of LTC dust kept as a legacy holding outside P&L.
- 06:33Z git archive: tag `archive/pre-options-2026-09-26` at `89bc49a1`, 78 branch tags
  `archive/branch/<name>`, laptop-only branches bundled on the owner's machine; 14 open pull requests
  closed with a comment naming their tag.
- 06:36Z the old state moved aside to `/workspace/archive/state-pre-options-20260926` on the House
  box and a fresh, empty `/workspace/state` made; 06:54Z its tarball written (8,256,763,269 bytes,
  sha256 `e9e5c04482a3321707902dd376a9902fe260954cd76cbe204eec89be6a16256f`, `gzip -t` OK). Two
  checkpoints of the House box failed (Sail 503, 06:35Z and 07:00Z).
- 06:37-06:39Z 420 old Sail boxes terminated (agent sandboxes, lab and foundry boxes, canaries).
